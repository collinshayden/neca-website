            The New England Amateur Team Championship will be an annual 4 player team event based on the rules of the World Amateur Team tournament
            that takes place in New Jersey each year. The only rule modification is that instead of the team average requirement being U2200, it will be
            U1800. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The format will be four rounds of G90+30 across two days.
