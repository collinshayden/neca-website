      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the official website of the New England Chess Association! We
        are a new organization, founded by Hayden Collins and NM Joseph
        Truelson, with the aim to grow and support chess activity in New
        England. This chess association will also be the governing body over the
        New England Grand Prix and the New England Amateur Team Championship,
        both of which are new events that will be launched in 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
      As we are located in Vermont and New Hampshire, our short-term focus will primarily be to grow chess in our local communities.
      We are hoping that directors from the rest of New England will include their events in the Grand Prix and aid in the growth of
      New England chess. 
    </p>
