      This page is dedicated for chess clubs that are located within New
      England. Attending your local club is a great way to get involved with
      your local chess scene and meet like-minded folks. As this website is
      quite new, this list is by no means comprehensive. If you don't see your
      local club on this list, feel free to let us know about it or share this
      site with the organizer.
